## Community-Building and Project Ideation Activities
Use the following activities in your next session to help members get to know each other and start thinking about impactful projects.

### Activity 1: Walkthrough of the Neural Network Young AI Leaders (YAIL) Platform (20 minutes)
- **Goal**: Ensure every member can navigate the platform, connect with peers, and access resources.
- **Flow**:
  - Live demo of core features (profiles, messaging, events, resources)
  - Members update their profile interests and SDG focus areas
  - Add 2–3 connections within the Lagos hub and 1–2 from other hubs

### Activity 2: 5-Minute Round of Introductions (15–20 minutes)
- **Goal**: Build quick rapport and awareness of member strengths and interests.
- **Prompt**: Name, role/skills, top SDG interests, one idea/problem you care about.

### Activity 3: 30-Minute Project Brainstorm (SDG-Focused)
- **Focus**: Brainstorm and discuss potential AI projects that address local needs and align with the SDGs.
- **Guiding Questions**:
  - What are the most urgent challenges in our community that could be addressed with AI?
  - Which SDGs are most relevant to our city or region?
  - How can AI solutions make a measurable impact on these SDGs?
  - Are there existing AI tools or technologies that we can adapt or build upon?
  - What resources or partnerships would be needed to implement the project?
  - How can AI improve accessibility, inclusivity, or efficiency in addressing these needs?
  - How will we measure the success of the AI project in terms of its contribution to the SDGs?
  - Are there ethical considerations or potential biases in using AI for this purpose? How can we address them?
  - How can we involve local stakeholders to ensure the project’s sustainability and relevance?
  - What skills or expertise do we already have within the group to support this project? What additional skills might we need?

## Recruitment: How Members Can Get Involved
Invite members to co-lead recruitment and onboarding. This builds ownership and grows capacity.

### Roles Members Can Take
- **Platform Onboarding Buddy**: Call new members after they sign up to the Neural Network YAIL platform and show them how to use it.
- **Design & Communications**: Create visual materials and short posts to promote recruitment.
- **Interview Coordinator**: Help organize interviews (online/onsite), schedule slots, share prompts.
- **Outreach Lead**: Connect with universities, communities, and partners to source candidates.

### Process (Lightweight)
1. **Intake**: Collect interest forms and link to YAIL platform signup.
2. **Screen**: 10–15 minute intro call to understand interests, availability, and SDG focus.
3. **Interview**: 25–30 minutes with 2 hub members; assess motivation, ethics mindset, and collaboration.
4. **Try-Out**: Invite candidates to join one Working Groups Sprint or Listening Session.
5. **Decision & Onboard**: Share decision, add to platforms, assign an onboarding buddy.

### Decision-Making Policy (Important)
- **Once the hub reaches 10 members or more, include all hub members in the decision to select any new member.**
  - Share candidate summary, interview notes, and a 48-hour window for feedback/vote.
  - Finalize selections transparently and document rationale.

### Interview Toolkit (Quick)
- **Sample questions**: Motivation, SDG focus, time commitment, teamwork example, ethics scenario, preferred learning style.
- **Evaluation criteria (1–5)**: Mission alignment, ethics mindset, collaboration, reliability, relevant skills.
- **Templates**: Confirmation note, interview schedule, decision email.

---

## Operational Notes
- **Accessibility**: Offer hybrid options (onsite + online) where possible; share materials in advance.
- **Contingencies**: If a meeting clashes with a public holiday/exam period, poll members and shift by 7 days.
- **Documentation**: Keep notes, decisions, and action items in a shared folder; assign owners with due dates.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm any time changes needed for your team and update calendar invites.
2. Assign owners for each meeting type and for the three activities above.
3. Publish this schedule in your communication channels and the YAIL platform.
4. Start pairing onboarding buddies with new members.

If you want, I can also generate calendar (.ics) files for these events and a lightweight sign-up sheet.
